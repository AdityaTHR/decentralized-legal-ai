# Decentralized AI Legal Assistant - HackOdisha 5.0

## Overview
The Decentralized AI Legal Assistant is an AI-powered application designed to simplify legal document processing in India. It supports multilingual summarization, semantic search, entity extraction, and petition generation with special focus on Odia language support. The backend is optimized for deployment on Akash Networkâ€™s decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure, allowing users to access advanced AI without any local resource requirements.

## Features
- **Document Summarization**: AI-powered summaries of legal documents in English and Odia.
- **Semantic Search**: Natural language search for relevant legal precedents.
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract legal entities, citations, dates, and amounts.
- **Petition Generation**: Auto-generate professionally formatted legal petitions.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Documents processed on decentralized infrastructure without retention.
- **Universal Access**: Works on any device, no GPU or installation required.
- **Akash Network Deployment**: Leveraging permissionless GPU cloud for cost-effective AI processing.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI, PyTorch (GPU-accelerated), Transformers, SentenceTransformers, spaCy
- Frontend: Modern responsive HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Deployment: Docker, Akash Network (SDL configuration provided)
- OCR Support: pdf2image, pytesseract for scanned legal documents

## Getting Started
